      <h2><strong>Context</strong></h2>
      <p>While working on a B2B SaaS product, I was tasked with designing the look and feel of the product’s notification system. I collaborated with UX and visual designers to transform UX wireframes into high-fidelity mockups. Throughout this project, I oversaw the creation of new variants to existing design tokens, and maintained their alignment to the current design system.</p>

      <h2><strong>Goals & Challenges</strong></h2>
      <p>Introduce a brand new feature to a product while upholding visual cohesion with established designs.</p>

  <h2><strong>A Whole New World</strong></h2>
    <p>At the start of the project, I had been working alongside a team of talented designers on a powerful asset management tool for several years. As robust as the tool was, it lacked an important feature that had not yet been tackled by any of our brilliant minds: notifications.</p>

    <p class="endSection">We always knew that notifications were a critical feature of our tool; however, it was a feature that everyone needed but no one owned. Eventually the need for the feature was evident and the issue was finally addressed by notifications making a high-priority topic. A number of designers, including myself, were assigned to work on integrating them into the main tool.</p>


   <h2><strong>Details Details</strong></h2>
    <p>There were many needs for the project. For one, the notifications needed to be listed out in a clear, readable manner. There also needed to be ways for users to manipulate them through changing their read state, adjusting their visibility through archiving, and setting reminders for specific notifications. Finally, there was a need for a summary view of all of the notifications and for pertinent information to appear at the top.</p>

    <p>The UX designers took off and solved the interaction and workflow issues, while I took care of the information hierarchy and visuals.</p>

    <h2><strong>What's in Store</strong></h2>

    <p class="endSection">While the development phase of this project has ended, I'm eagerly awaitng if there will be potential additions to what already exists. I'm particularly interested in any options for users to create their own notifications categories and set custom reminders for them.</p>

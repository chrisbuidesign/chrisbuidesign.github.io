      <h2><strong>Timeline</strong></h2>

      <h2><strong>Context</strong></h2>
      <p>As a attempt to strengthen my design skills outside of work, I took a course at SVA called "Experiencing Brands Through Interaction Design". I was intrigued by the concept of the course and thought it would be a good opportunity to learn more about branding.</p>
      <p>Voice Point is a brand that stemmed from my interest in voice acting and my desire  incorporate it in my design work. While researching, I noticed that there was a gap in voice acting resources, where it was very difficult to find a single source of education, collaboration, and networking. I took the opportunity to create something that might close that gap: Voice Point, a one-week hybrid conference for working and aspiring voice actors, fans, and other professionals in the industry. </p>
      <p class = "endPara"> The final result was a creative brief, a defined visual system, and a series of high-fedility mockups for both web and mobile platforms.</p>
      <h2><strong>Goals & Challenges</strong></h2>
      <p>Create a distinct brand that supports the growth of the voice acting community while addressing weaknesses commonly found in other resources.</p>

  <h2><strong>In the Beginning...</strong></h2>
    <p>The creative spirit of voice acting inspired me and I wanted to create a brand that stood out from the competition. I noticed that not many competitors had a strong brand or a sense of visual cohesion on their websites.</p>

    <p class ='endPara'>In order to develop the brand’s character, I explored many potential directions.</p>

    <img class = "captionedImage" src="images/projects/VoicePoint/Moodboard.jpg">
    <p class="imageCaption">One of the many moodboards I put together for the project.</p>

    <p class ='endPara'>During these early stages, I didn't quite have a sense of what I wanted to create. However, I did know that I wanted to make something bright and bold to reflect the voice acting industry.</p>

    <img class = "captionedImage" src="images/projects/VoicePoint/FirstLogos.png">
    <p class="imageCaption">Potential logo designs</p>

    <img class = "captionedImage" src="images/projects/VoicePoint/FirstMockups.png">
    <p class="imageCaption">Trying out a color palette and a sample web layout</p>

    <p class ='endPara'>Eventually I refined the color palette into something loud, but simple. I wanted the brand to be a vehicle for eduational and career resources in addition to being attention-grabbing. I didn't want the brand to be too distracting and potentially take away from its credibility, so I settled on a nice combination of black, white, and teal.</p>
    
    <img class = "captionedImage" src="images/projects/VoicePoint/RefinedColors.png">
    <p class="imageCaption">Testing different logo and color combinations</p>

    <p class ='endPara'>I also took the opportunity to create an eye-catching wordmark. While Voice Point is meant to be taken seriously, that doesn't mean it can't be playful or artsy. In my search for a typeface for the logotype, I stumbled upon Batsand, an incredible handpainted script by Lettersiro Studio. I knew it was the perfect match for my brand.</p>


    <img class = "captionedImage" src="images/projects/VoicePoint/RefinedLogo.png">
    <p class="imageCaption">Logo options</p>


   <h2><strong>Rebellious, Exciting, Purposeful</strong></h2>
    <p></p>

    <p class ='endPara'>After a series of refinements, I put together a finalized visual system for Voice Point. It details all of the elements of the brand and how they may be used. </p>

    <img class = "captionedImage" src="images/projects/VoicePoint/Motifs.png">
    <p class="imageCaption">Common brand motifs</p>


    <h2><strong>Hi-Fi Mockups</strong></h2>
    <p class ='endPara'>Mockups were created for both web and mobile to show the brand’s versatility in different touchpoints.</p>

    <img class = "captionedImage" src="images/projects/VoicePoint/Homepage.jpg">
    <p class="imageCaption">Home page</p>

    <img class = "captionedImage" src="images/projects/VoicePoint/ReelReview.png">
    <p class="imageCaption">The Reel Review page, where people can listen to your audio reel and give feedback.</p>


    <img class = "captionedImage" src="images/projects/VoicePoint/VideoLibrary.png">
    <p class="imageCaption">If the live version of an educational session is missed, it can be accessed as a recording in the video library.</p>


    <img class = "captionedImage" src="images/projects/VoicePoint/MobileScreens.png">
    <p class="imageCaption">Mobile versions of the Video Library, Auditions, Reel Review, and Messages pages.</p>


  <h2><strong>Future Plans</strong></h2>

    <p class="endSection">I would also like to flesh out some of the pages more since not all of them were covered in this initial conceptual stage. Afterwards, maybe I could find a developer to make my vision a real website and app! </p>
